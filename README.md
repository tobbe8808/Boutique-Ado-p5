## Business model B2C

My Business model for my E-commerce website is B2C Business to consumer.
The Hardware Guru knows there is a lot of competition in the PC components market, that's why we focus on holding down our prices and give the best service we can to customers.
The absolute biggest value for the customer on our site is that they get the support needed and to ask questions before buying if they are unsure what they want.
It could be what graphics card gives the best preformance of the current parts they have on their PC, or what processor has the most performance for their budget, or even just asking if a part will fit on their motherboard. We also have market competitive prices and free shipping on orders over 75$, but as a small PC shop it's hard to get the lowest prices so we focus to excel in service to get returning customers that value service.
The target consumer is people interested in gaming and video editing cause those are the most normal tasks that require a lot of performance out of your PC.

## Marketing Strategies

As am a small business and don't wanna spend any money on marketing i will use Facebook and email marketing.
Social media I will make a Facebook business page and market my sales and answer questions from people interested in my products, and post updates about the shop posting new incoming products and maybe contests with prices and more, and even use other social platforms. I will use email newsletter as a marketing tool so people that are intrested can sign up and get the newest hotest deals and know first when new products are in stock, and other special offers.
I will also use try to market the website on local sell sites that has free advertisement.
Also i will use my personal facebook to try to get people i know to see the company and mabey get some customers that way.
Its a small business with not alot of money to spend so marketing on socials and free advertisement website is a good way to start a customer base.
example of local Marketing is using Blocket.se its one of swedens most used advertisement website where advertisement is free or in some cases cost very little.

## Deployment to Heroku

1. First go to the Heroku website and make a new app.
2. Choose the region that is closest to you and an app name.
3. On the resources tab in heroku add Postgres free plan as an addon.
4. Go back to gitpod and install dj_database_url and psycopg2-binary with pip3 install.
5. Make sure you freeze the requirements with pip3 freeze > requirements.txt so heroku can get all the data.
6. In settings.py import dj_database_url.
7. Comment out the sqlite database.
8. Add dj_database_url.parse() to the databases.
9. Insert the postgres link inside parse() that you get from settings/config vars in Heroku.
10. Run migrations so its updated to the postgres database.
11. If you used fixtures run /python3 manage.py loaddata categories or whatever you called it.
12. If you got more to add you run the command in 11 again.
13. Make a superuser account for the postgres database.
14. Remove the postgres database and uncomment the sqlite database so it doesn't end up in version control.
15. Commit the changes.
16. Write an if/else statement for the databases to connect to Heroku when in os.environ or else connect to sqlite.
17. Install gunicorn with pip3.
18. Freeze it so gunicorn goes into the requirements.txt
19. Create a Procfile on the main location and add gunicorn code.
20. Login to Heroku in the gitpod terminal.
21. disable collect static with DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 so heroku doesn't collect static files.
22. Add Heroku url to the ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py.
23. Push to github and Heroku, you don't need to push to Heroku if you already have setup auto deployment to Heroku with git push.
24. Generate a django key with a django random secret key generator.
25. Add the random secret key to the Heroku Config Vars.
26. Go back to settings.py and replace the SECRET_KEY with the generated key.
27. Set debug to true only if the environment is a development environment.
28. Commit changes to github/Heroku.
29. Register for an AWS account.
30. Go to s3 and create a new bucket.
31. With the settings you got create the bucket.
32. Turn on static websitehosting on your new bucket.
33. Create and setup the Identify and Access Management(IAM).
34. Install boto3 and Django-storages with pip3 in the Gitpod terminal.
35. Freeze the requirements.txt.
36. connect AWS via your settings.py with if USE_AWS.
37. Go back to Heroku config vars and add the AWS keys, and USE_AWS.
38. Remove collectstatic from Heroku so it will collect them from AWS s3.
39. Create custom_storage.py for media and static files storage code.
40. In settings.py add code to use the static and media storage class and location.
41. Commit and push to github and Heroku.
42. In the s3 bucket make a new folder for your media files.
43. Upload the images to the folder in s3.
44. Add the stipe keys to your Heroku config variables.
45. Create a new webhook endpoint in Stripe so it connects to the deployed site.
46. Add the signing secret to heroku config variables.

**If you dident use fixtures you need to get the data from your Sqlite database.**

47. Make sure you are connected to the sqlite database so you can get the data.
48. Make a backup of the app's data that you want. For the example, we will use the "product" app.
49. Make a backup with the command python3 manage.py dumpdata products > products.json to backup products.
50. Connect yourself to the postgres database.
51. Transfer the backup json file you just created with command python3 manage.py loaddata products.json
52. Now you should see the products in development.
